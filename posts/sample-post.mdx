# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post on my new personal website. I built this site using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## What I'll Be Writing About

I plan to share:

- My projects and technical experiments
- Thoughts on software development
- Learning experiences and challenges
- Interesting problems I've solved

## About This Site

This website is built with modern web technologies:

- **Next.js** for the framework
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **MDX** for writing blog posts with rich content

Feel free to explore and reach out if you'd like to connect!
